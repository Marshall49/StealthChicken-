Stealth Chicken - About

- This is a web application that connects physicians of all specialties together,
and allowing them to collaborate and share patient data within and compare notes
share different success stories with their patients. Within the application as well,
the physician will have a personal page where they can see all of their post and the post
that they commented on.

Functionality
- Once a physician logs in to their account they will then see all of the "Hot" Activity
within the general forum or the speciality forum they choose.
- They can then "post" a comment/question on that specific page and other physicians
will be able to comment on that post.
- (For Later Use) - If a physician comments on a particular post and multiple doctors who view
the post and "Like" the post that doctor will accrue points that will then lead up to
potential bonuses/rewards.

Dexcom
- Another aspect to the application will be the Dexcom app where it can authorize doctors to use
their patients data and share it.
- Once the patient confirms and authorizes the physician to use their data, the doctor can then
monitor their progress and results in real time.
