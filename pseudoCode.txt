Plan to scale up data called for dexcom
Step 1
- Data pulled by API is limited to one month
- Requirements to achieve before next step
  - API call pulls data and stores it to a MongoDB document
  - Data can be pulled up from Mongo DB to a case document
  - Data can be displayed using chart.js on case

Step 2
- Pull all 2 years of data for patient to MongoDB document
- Add a patient identifier (Patient 1, 2, etc.) for physician to choose between patients
- Allow physician to choose dates for data to pull from Mongo for chosen patient
- Requirements to achieve before next step
  - Allow doctor to choose from list of patients (drop down, search, etc)
  - Allow doctor to choose date range for patient data
  - Step 1 requirements

Step 3
- Use API call to get patient's user access token
- Use API call to dexcom to get data and input directly into case document
- Requirements to achieve before next step
  - Step 1 and 2 requirements achieved using Access token and API call

Step 4
- Add physician code to profile that only physician can see
- Patient can be given code and will be prompted for physician code when authorizing data
- This will allow only entered doctor to use patient data for case
- Requirements
  - Patient prompted for doctor code
  - Doctor code successfully applied to object with patient access token
  - Doctor patient list propagated with only patients entering the doctor's code
  - Steps 1,2,3 requirements
